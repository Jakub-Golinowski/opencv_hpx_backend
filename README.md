# opencv_hpx_backend
HPX Backend for OpenCV - The Image processing toolbox OpenCV supports multithreading in multiple ways, i.a. via TBB or OpenMP, but not with the use of HPX. Therefore, OpenCV should be equipped with reliable HPX support for parallelism. In this way both the performance of the OpenCV and the reach of HPX will be increased.
